  This dataset captures cultural attitudes towards
  machine vision technologies as they are expressed
  in art, games and narratives. The dataset includes
  records of 500 creative works (including 77 digital
  games, 191 digital artworks and 236 movies, novels
  and other narratives) that use or represent machine
  vision technologies like facial recognition,
  deepfakes, and augmented reality. The dataset is
  divided into three main tables, relating to the
  works, to specific situations in each work
  involving machine vision technologies, and to the
  characters that interact with the technologies.
  Data about each work includes title, author, year
  and country of publication; types of machine vision
  technologies featured; topics the work addresses,
  and sentiments associated with that machine vision
  usage in the work. In the various works we
  identified 884 specific situations where machine
  vision is central. The dataset includes detailed
  data about each of these situations that describes
  the actions of human and non-human agents,
  including machine vision technologies. The dataset
  is the product of a digital humanities project and
  can be also viewed as a database at
  http://machine-vision.no.
  Data was collected by a team of topic experts who
  followed an analytical model developed to explore
  relationships between humans and technologies,
  inspired by posthumanist and feminist new
  materialist theories. The project team identified
  relevant works by searching databases, visiting
  exhibitions and conferences, reading scholarship,
  and consulting other experts. The inclusion
  criteria were creative works( art, games,
  narratives (movies, novels, etc)) where one of the
  following machine vision technologies was used in
  or represented by the work: 3D scans, AI, Augmented
  reality, Biometrics, Body scans, Camera,
  Cameraphone, Deepfake, Drones, Emotion recognition,
  Facial recognition, Filtering, Holograms, Image
  generation, Interactive panoramas Machine learning,
  MicroscopeOrTelescope Motion tracking, Non-Visible
  Spectrum Object recognition, Ocular implant,
  Satellite images, Surveillance cameras, UGV,
  Virtual reality, and Webcams.
  The dataset as well as the more detailed database
  can be viewed, searched, extracted, or otherwise
  used or reused and is considered particularly
  useful for humanities and social science scholars
  interested in the relationship between technology
  and culture, and by designers, artists, and
  scientists developing machine vision technologies.
